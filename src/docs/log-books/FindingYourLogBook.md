You can usually expect a log book to be empty when you first open it however club staff such as coaches and view, add to and edit your log book, which means some training could have already been populated.

## If you have a member account

*You have a member account if you sign in using your Swim England (ASA) number and a password. These accounts are usually for swimmers, divers, water polo players who have a parent who holds the main account*

Go to your membership system website on your phone, tablet or computer.

You'll be presented with a page like this.
