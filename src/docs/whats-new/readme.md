# What's new?

Welcome to the **What's new** digest for the SCDS Membership Software. There will be a publication every month detailing new features and changes.

* If you're a member of club staff, you'll be able to choose how to deliver training on new features that are referenced here.
* If you're a keen parent/club member, these publications will let you know what we're doing to improve the membership system.

We're always looking for feedback. You can contact us via [feedback@myswimmingclub.uk](mailto:feedback@myswimmingclub.uk).
