# What's new in September 2020?

Welcome to the latest **What's new** digest for the SCDS Membership Software. There is a publication every month detailing new features and changes.

* If you're a member of club staff, you'll be able to choose how to deliver training on new features that are referenced here.
* If you're a keen parent/club member, these publications will let you know what we're doing to improve the membership system.

We're always looking for feedback. You can contact us via [feedback@myswimmingclub.uk](mailto:feedback@myswimmingclub.uk).

## Session Booking

Tools for session booking have been added to aid clubs through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clubs can now declare any upcoming session to *Require Booking*. Clubs can place limits on session capacity and in future we will support Pay As You Go bookings (paid on the next Direct Debit).

Automatic confirmation and cancellation emails are sent to users.

Booking is open until 15 minutes before session start time, at which point a register is generated automatically by a cron job (in the [MEV system](https://github.com/Swimming-Club-Data-Systems/Membership-Event-Handler)).

## One-off sessions

Clubs can now add one-off sessions through a new tool, which will eventually also become the new *Add sessions* tool.

These sessions can be opened to multiple squads, a feature which will be added for regular sessions soon.

## *Sessions* page renamed as *Timetable*

The sessions page and links have been renamed as *Timetable*. Old links still work.

## Special Features for University of Sheffield Swimming and Water Polo Club

Return to training features for UoSSWPC have been added and are subject to their own help documentation.
