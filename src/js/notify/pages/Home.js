                <h2>How to Use Notify</h2>
                <p>
                  Notify is available to squad coaches, system administrators and and squad reps. It allows you to send an email to parents/account holders of selected groups of members. It is possible to create a custom group of members (called a Targeted List), or to use a squad or a gala. You can send to any combination of squads and lists just by ticking boxes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Click on &quot;Notify Composer&quot; to write an email message. All emails sent will be personally addressed to each user who reciceves them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Emails are added to a queue to be sent. Emails will be sent to all users almost instantaneously. Users who have not opted in to recieving emails will not receive messages.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Please be aware:</strong> If you Force Send an email, you will be contacted by your System Administrator and asked to justify why you did so. This is because of our obligations under the GDPR rules. Acceptable use of Force Send includes;
