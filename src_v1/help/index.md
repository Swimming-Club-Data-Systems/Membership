# Membership System Help and Support

Welcome to the Help and Support Documentation for the Membership System by Chester-le-Street ASC and Swimming Club Data Systems (SCDS).

We're slowly building up a collection of support documentation for parents and club officials. For now, you can find parent help and support on the [Chester-le-Street ASC Website](https://www.chesterlestreetasc.co.uk).

## How to get more help

### Parents

Always speak to an official from your own club first. They will be able to access help and support from SCDS as required.

In order to manage workload, parents are unable to access support from SCDS beyond the documentation provided here and on the [Chester-le-Street ASC Website](https://www.chesterlestreetasc.co.uk).

### Club Officials

If you are unable to resolve your own or a parent's problem, contact SCDS by emailing support@myswimmingclub.co.uk quoting your name, club and position as well as giving as much detail about the problem as possible.

### Self Hosted

If you're a self hosted user, support from SCDS is unavailable. You may wish to speak to your technical manager who will be able to work with [SCDS via GitHub](https://github.com/Chester-le-Street-ASC/Membership).
