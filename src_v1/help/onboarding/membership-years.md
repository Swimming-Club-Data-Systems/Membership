# Membership Years

## What is a membership year?

A membership year is a period of time in which a member can hold a membership. Membership years have a start and end date and members can hold memberships from multiple membership years concurrently.

In most cases, you will create a membership year that runs 1 January to 31 December of any given year. Members then have a type of membership, for example Swim England Club Train (Category 2) assigned to them for that membership year.

This allows the system to track which memberships a member has already been assigned in a year - important when you upgrade from Cat 1 to Cat 2.

At some clubs, you may run a club membership year at different times to the Swim England membership year. This is supported behaviour by the membership system and you can choose to run renewal for both at the same time or seperately.
