# COVID-19 Contact Tracing

## What is it for?

HM Government requires that designated venues in certain sectors must have a system in place to request and record contact details of their customers, visitors and staff to help break the chains of transmission of coronavirus.

It is also prudent for sectors above and beyond this to do so.

## How do I use SCDS Contact Tracing tools?

How you use our tools depends on how your club has chosen to perform contact tracing. Your club will either;

* Require you to check in yourself on arrival at sessions
* Check in your members on your behalf (assuming you do not get out your car and enter your building)

If your club is checking in members on your behalf, it's likely you do not have to do anything for contact tracing.

If you need to check in yourself, please [read our help guide](./check-in.md).
