# Adding a payment card

## Adding a card

To add a payment card to your club membership account, select **Pay** from the main menu and then **Add a Credit or Debit Card**.

On this page enter all the requested information. You will need to provide;

* Cardholder name
* Address
* Postal code
* Card number
* Expiry date
* CVV/CVC code

Under the new Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) rules, you may be asked by your bank to verify your identity when adding a card. Follow the instructions shown on screen if this happens.

Youâ€™ll be able to use your card for any future payments. Due to the SCA rules you may still be asked by your bank to verify your identity for any payment.

## Alternative ways to add a card

Whenever you use a new card on a checkout page, we'll save your details for future payments.

We won't save card details when you pay with a secure wallet such as Apple Pay or Google Pay.
