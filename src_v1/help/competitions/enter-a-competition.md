# Entering a competition

Please be aware that the system does not support open water events or galas where 25m events are being competed. For these competitions, please continue to use a paper gala entry form, which will be supplied by your club, or follow local instructions.

## Filling out the Form

Filling out your entry couldn’t be simpler. Select the following information;

* The name of the swimmer
* The name of the gala
* Select the events you would like to enter
* You may be asked the amount due
* and you may be asked to supply times for each event if the gala is run using the HyTek system.

> You will need to fill out the form for each swimmer you are entering – You are unable to make multiple entries in one go

## Your Confirmation Email

You will automatically receive an email from us listing all of the details that you provided and the events you have entered. Please be aware that this email is only for verification that information submitted was correct and for your piece of mind that we have received your entry.

This confirmation email is not however proof that your child has been entered into a gala or that your child has been accepted into a gala by the club hosting it. It is up to you to check the accepted entries when they are published. Please retain the email for your records.

## Amending an Entry

If you need to amend an entry, log into your account again. You can see all your entries, and edit them if they have either not been processed, paid for, or the closing date has not passed.

## Paying for entries

Galas can be paid for by credit or debit card, as part of your next monthly direct debit payment or if you tell the treasurer, cash, cheque or bank transfer.

Follow the instructions after you’ve made a gala entry if you wish to pay by card.

If you’re making more than one entry, wait until after you’ve made all entries to pay by card as this helps save us money on transaction fees.
