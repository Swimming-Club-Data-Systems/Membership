# Contact Tracing

:::info

All COVID-19 regulations in England have now been withdrawn. COVID-19 features will remain available for the forseeable future.

:::

## What is it for?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, government regulations required that designated venues in certain sectors must have a system in place to request and record contact details of their customers, visitors and staff to help break the chains of transmission of coronavirus.

It is also prudent for sectors above and beyond this to do so.

## How do I use SCDS Contact Tracing tools?

How you use our tools depends on how your club has chosen to perform contact tracing. Your club will either;

* Require you to check in yourself on arrival at sessions
* Check in your members on your behalf (assuming you do not get out your car and enter your building)

If your club is checking in members on your behalf, it's likely you do not have to do anything for contact tracing.

## Checking in

### How to check in

Checking in on arrival at a training session is easy.

### If a poster is displayed

If your club has displayed a poster with a QR code, please scan the code and follow the instructions.

### When no poster is displayed

* Navigate to your club membership system page
* Select *COVID-19* from the main menu
* Select *Contact Tracing*
* Select your current location
* Follow the instructions on screen

### Speeding up check in

If you're logged into your club account on your device, when you reach the check in page you can just tick which members are present and we can autofill your contact details.
