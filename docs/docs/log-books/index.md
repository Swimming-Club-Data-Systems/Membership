# Log books

## About log books

Log books are a brand new membership system feature that let you log your home based dry-land train training.

They were initially introduced as a response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which caused the cancellation of almost all swimming training in the UK.

We plan to add more log book features if they prove popular.
