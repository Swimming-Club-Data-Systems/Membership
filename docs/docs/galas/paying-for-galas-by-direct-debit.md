# Paying for gala entries as part of your direct debit

## What will happen

You’ll enter a gala online as normal. If all swims at a gala are the same price, we’ll work out the fee for you. If not, we’ll need you to tell us when making your entry.

When we send the entries to the host club, we’ll add your entry fees to your club account as pending charges. On the first working day of the next month we’ll sum your charges and you will pay your squad fees and gala entry fees as part of one single direct debit payment.
Handling rejections

## When rejections are received we will add the refund to your club account as a credit.

* If rejections are received and processed within the same calendar month as we submit the entries, you will automatically pay the correct amount.
* If rejections are received and processed outside the same calendar month as we submit the entries, you will get a discount off your next bill*.

## If you don’t pay by direct debit

Some families don’t pay squad fees by direct debit due to unique circumstances. They will continue to pay as normal by cash, cheque or bank transfer.

If for legal reasons it will not be possible for you to pay for gala entries by direct debit, you will be able to opt out in the advanced options menu of the membership system.

\**This is assuming you make no further gala entries.*
