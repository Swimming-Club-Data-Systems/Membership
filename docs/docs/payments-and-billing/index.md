# Payments and Billing (V2)

We've rebuilt our payment integration from the ground up to bring clubs new ways to pay and keep track of income.

Payments and Billing (V2) introduces new concepts such as journals to give you a clearer picture of amounts owed by a
member, introduces support for guest payments and allows you to take payments using any payment method supported by
our service provider, Stripe.
