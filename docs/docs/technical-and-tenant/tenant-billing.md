# Tenant Billing

Clubs (tenants) pay a monthly subscription for the membership system. Payment is now taken automatically on the first day of each month. If a club needs to pay at a different date, for cashflow reasons, they can contact SCDS for a bespoke arrangement.

## Payment Methods

You can currently pay for the membership system by;

- Credit, debit or charge card
- Direct Debit

We continually review our payment options and may add additional payment methods in future.

## Adding a payment method

To manage your club's billing account, you'll need to have the `SCDS Payments Manager` user permission for your account. This also means you must be an admin for your tenant.

This permission can be added by selecting your user from the user directory, then selecting edit and ticking the boxes to add the appropriate permissions.

To add a payment method, select *Admin* from the main menu, then select *SCDS Payments* from the *All tools* list. This will take you to the Billing Portal where you can see your subscription, edit your payment methods and see previous invoices.

**If you want to pay by Direct Debit, you can't currently set up a Direct Debit Instruction via the customer portal. In this case you should request a setup link from SCDS. Once set up, you will need to request that SCDS set it as the payment method for your subscription.**

## Invoices and receipts

Our payment partner will send an email receipt when your payment has been successful. This will include a copy of your invoice and receipt.

If you pay by Direct Debit, you will be sent an email confirming the amount three working days before the payment is taken but these may not include a copy of the invoice.

## Billing Periods

All billing is currently monthly and you will get one invoice on the first day of each month with all items on it.

SCDS keeps its services under review so may add additional products which are billed differently or may change the billing periods and methods for existing products in future.

## Service suspension due to non-payment

In the event of non-payment, SCDS may withdraw service to a tenant. Clubs will be given the opportunity to arrange payment before this happens.

If your service is suspended, direct debit payments from members may not be processed, or may fail and you will be unable to access user data.
