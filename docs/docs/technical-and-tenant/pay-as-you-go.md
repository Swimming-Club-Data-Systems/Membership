# Pay As You Go

SCDS is rolling out additional features which are not included in the monthly subscription fee such as Notify SMS functionality which is billed on a per message basis.

These features utilise a Pay As You Go balance which you must top up in advance.

To top up your Pay As You Go balance, navigate to your tenant in SCDS System Administration and select *Pay As You Go* from the menu. You'll see your current balance on screen.

## Top up your Pay As You Go balance

You can only use credit, debit or charge cards to top up your Pay As You Go balance. We don't accept Direct Debit payments for top ups due to the time taken for the payment to be confirmed.
