										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swimmers and Parents/Carers will realise that it would not be possible to deliver the Regional Swimming Championships in April/May 2021 with the current social distancing rules are in place.</p>
<p>The indications are that the current social distancing restrictions will not be relaxed by HM Government for some time.<br />
Although age group swimmers could be allowed to return to the pool on 12th April (not confirmed until 5th April) senior swimmers will not be returning until after the Championships would have taken place.</p>
<p>Clearly most age group swimmers would not be fit enough to compete in a Regional Championships two weeks after returning to the pool.</p>
<p>The Swim England Swimming Leadership Group are working on plans to enable competitive swimming to return as soon as conditions allow. We will keep you updated on progress.</p>
<p>We hope that it may be possible to hold our Regional Championships (25m) in November 2021 as planned.<br />
I realise that this will be a disappointment to many swimmers but the safety of our members must take priority over all other considerations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Various potential funding opportunities are available for clubs to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Sport England</strong> – Return to Play: Small Grants (Capital Funding included) The Return to Play: Small Grants fund seeks to support projects addressing the challenges Covid-19 has posed to people taking part in sport and physical activity. Grants between £300 and £10,000 are available to help sport and activity groups, clubs and organisations respond to the immediate challenges of returning to play in a coronavirus-safe way. This could include contributing to covering the costs incurred by having to deliver activity in smaller groups than normal, or having the correct hygiene and safety equipment. Applications are currently being accepted with notification of decisions within three weeks. Applications can be submitted at any time until 30 June 2021. <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/our-funds/return-play-small-grants">https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/our-funds/return-play-small-grants</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sport England</strong> – Return to Play: Community Asset Fund (Capital Funding included) This fund will make awards of between £10,001 and £50,000 to help local sports clubs and organisations adapt and open important places and spaces to help their local community return to play safely. This could include contributing to covering the costs incurred by converting existing space to meet social distancing guidelines, or improving a facility’s ventilation. Applications are currently being accepted with notification of decisions within three weeks. <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/our-funds/return-play-community-asset-fund">https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/our-funds/return-play-community-asset-fund</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Made by Sport</strong> &#8211; Thousands of grassroots sports organisations could each receive a grant of £2021 to help them recover from the Covid-19 pandemic after the Made By Sport charity received a donation of £4.79million from Flutter Entertainment. <a href="https://www.connectsport.co.uk/news/made-sport-distribute-grassroots-grants">https://www.connectsport.co.uk/news/made-sport-distribute-grassroots-grants</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coalfields Recovery &amp; Resilience Fund</strong> &#8211; The Coalfields Covid-19 Recovery &amp; Resilience Fund is an interim replacement for the Coalfields Community Investment Programme (CCIP). Awards of up to £10,000 are available to address local needs in coalfield communities.

<p><strong>Yorkshire and Humber Funders</strong> are collaborating to support charities and communities respond to Covid 19. Against the backdrop of the already existing needs and challenges of the people and places in our region funders that have been supporting charities and communities across Yorkshire and Humber are trying to up their game in response to the significantly greater call on all of them because of Covid 19. All six Community Foundations in Yorkshire and Humber are part of the We Stand With The Sector Funders Response and through the Yorkshire Funder’s Forum the aim is to work with other funders to increase collaboration between local, regional and national funders during this crisis for Yorkshire and Humber. The six Community Foundations will also be the main distributing partners of the National Emergencies Trust (NET) Appeal. <a href="https://www.yorkshirefunders.org.uk/">https://www.yorkshirefunders.org.uk/</a></p>
