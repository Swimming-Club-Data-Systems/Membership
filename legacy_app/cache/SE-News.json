Third in this event went to Hannah Russell in a time of 1:02.29.<\/p>\n<p>Plymouth Leander swimmer and multi World record holder Reece Dunn posted a time of 1:59.56 in the Men&#8217;s Multi-Class 200m Freestyle, taking the win ahead of Scotland&#8217;s Oliver Carter (2:02.89).<\/p>\n<p>Dylan Broom touched in a time of 2:04.17 to become the third athlete home.<\/p>\n<h2>Scott on top<\/h2>\n<p>Duncan Scott certainly made his mark in what was a stacked field in the Men&#8217;s 200m Freestyle. He took the win in a time of 1:46.70, which is the third-fastest time in the world so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking on his win in the event, Scott said: &#8220;200 Free in Britain is always good fun! I\u2019ve been doing some race simulations at home, but to come here and race some other guys has been really good. It was just so tight and that\u2019s what\u2019s so good about it \u2013 head to head racing gets a bit more out of you \u2013 it\u2019s really good looking ahead to trials and the 4&#215;200 relay.<\/p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;There\u2019s still plenty to do and plenty to learn. Some of the times were good but I think some of the execution of skills, there\u2019s a lot of room to improve. I\u2019m quite happy with where I am and I\u2019ve got a final phase now and then into taper, so I\u2019m quite excited for the next block.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Second place went to Tom Dean who was just 0.05 behind the Scotsman (1:46.75) and just 0.7 off his personal best in that event. Dean told British Swimming after the event: &#8220;I just wanted to come here and move it on from the Manchester International \u2013 that was the main aim. I had a bit of a shaky start to the three days in that 400, feeling a bit tired from training, but to finish off with that is good.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;GB 200 free is just a stacked event and it\u2019s always going to be an exciting race when you\u2019ve got eight top guys going head to head &#8211; that only bodes well for trials in a months\u2019 time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Third-place finisher in that event was Olympic silver medallist James Guy (1:47.47), who gave an impressive fight from the outside of the pool.<\/p>\n<p>The penultimate event of the session saw Scotland&#8217;s Abby Kane taking the win in the Women&#8217;s Multi-Class 200m Individual Medley (2:45.36, 630 points).<\/p>\n<p>British and World record holder Maisie Summers-Newton was next to the wall in a time of 3:00.09 (953), while Paralympic hopeful Grace Harvey followed just behind in 3:02.46 (916 points).<\/p>\n<p>The competition was rounded off with the Women&#8217;s 200m Individual Medley, which saw a tight battle between winner Candice Hall (2:15.12) and second place Lily Booker (2:15.41).<\/p>\n<p>The Loughborough and Milfield swimmers were followed closely by Scottish youngster Katie Shanahan, who touched in 2:16.40.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>British records fell on the final day of action at the British Swimming Invitation Meet with Ellie Challis, Scott Quin, and Louis Lawlor all creating new entries for the record books.

think I\u2019d break it in-season, I thought it\u2019d be at trials where I could have a go at it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels absolutely amazing, and obviously it was James Goddard\u2019s record before
