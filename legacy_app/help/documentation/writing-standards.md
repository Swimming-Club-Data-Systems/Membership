# Writing standards

Content authors are advised to follow the spirit of [the GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk), where appropriate.

Plain English is mandatory for all non-technical documentation. Technical documentation includes the current section and is exempt from this requirement.

Authors should regularly make use of screenshots to explain their written instructions.
