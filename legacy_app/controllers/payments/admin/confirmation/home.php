      <p class="lead">Confirmation lets you confirm an account balance has been paid when a parent does not use direct debit.</p>

      <p>Completing confirmation helps you keep track of the bigger picture financially and allows parents to see that their payment has been confirmed.</p>

      <p>If a parent paid with the reference given to them on their bill, confirmation is fast and easy. If they didn't, we can find their due payment by asking you a few more questions.</p>
